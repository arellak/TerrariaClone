# Terraria Clone Version 0.0.1
Since I played a lot of Terraria and Minecraft, I really liked the idea to implement my own version of it. It isn't really a clone since I don't try to copy each feature. My main focus is to get some experience in writing game code and get some practice in using different...well...practices. I'll only implement the basic idea of Terraria and Minecraft. A block/sandbox game. Everything else will be more or less my own creation.

It still is in very early development and I only continue sporadically. So far it was very fun and I learned a lot.
## How to play
Just start the executable...duh...
